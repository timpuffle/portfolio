                            The current Overwatch 2 Hero Gallery suffers from fragmented information architecture, 
                            specifically regarding weapon customization. Features such as Golden Weapons, 
                            Weapon Skins, and Charms are siloed into separate top-level categories, forcing 
                            users to navigate through redundant menus to complete a single "set." This 
                            increases interaction cost and obscures the relationship between related cosmetic items.
                        </p>

                        <p class="analysis-text">
                            Furthermore, the skin selection process relies on text-heavy list views that 
                            lack visual feedback. By requiring users to click individual names to see a 
                            3D preview, the interface creates a "trial and error" workflow. This lacks the 
                            scannability found in modern gaming interfaces, where visual grids are the 
                            industry standard for rapid comparison and decision-making.

                            I began by mapping out the current user flow and identifying "friction points" 
                            where navigation felt stalled. I brainstormed ways to make the cosmetic category navigation more seamless while upholding 
                            the traditional Overwatch design feel. Alongside my redesign wireframe, I recreated the current Overwatch UI in a matching 
                            wireframe style. The wireframes were multi-screened and semi functional for testing purposes. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>User Testing and Research</h3>
                        <p class="analysis-text">
                            To validate my assumptions, I conducted six user tests. I compared the existing text-based list 
                            against a visual grid by having users complete a series of tasks on both wireframe flows, followed by a few questions. 
                            The results validated my claims that the current UI restricts efficiency in ways that my design promotes it. The testing 
                            also showed me parts of the current UI that I should keep in my designs moving forward. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Iterative Wireframing</h3>
                        <p class="analysis-text">
                            Based on research insights, I developed multiple wireframe iterations. I shifted from a list-heavy sidebar to a visual grid system. 
                            This phase focused on refining my previous designs to ensure that while I was increasing information density, I wasn't sacrificing 
                            the "breathability" and clean aesthetic typical of Blizzard’s UI. Using my test data, I aimed to keep familiar anchors like the hero 
                            preview and top-level navigation, while completely overhauling the skin selection screen to reduce the "click-depth" required to find 
                            and equip a desired cosmetic.

                        <h3>UI Mockups</h3>
                        <p class="analysis-text">
                            Once I was happy with how my screens looked, the final step was translating wireframe logic into the polished Overwatch 2 visual 
                            language. I recreated all of the in-game elements that I was keeping in my redesign including the titles, username and profile 
                            picture, currency indicators, etc. The only elements not made by me in Figma were the character designs and background image.
